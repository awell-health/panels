# Issue Resolution Process: Three-Step Validation

When working on issues, bugs, or feature requests, follow this structured three-step process with mandatory validation at each stage:

## ❌ DO NOT:
- Jump directly to implementing solutions without proper diagnosis
- Move between phases without explicit user approval
- Skip the review phase after implementation
- Combine multiple phases into a single response
- Assume the first identified cause is the root cause

## ✅ DO:
- **DIAGNOSE**: Analyze symptoms thoroughly and identify true root causes
- **IMPLEMENT**: Design and apply comprehensive solutions to root causes
- **REVIEW**: Assess code quality, readability, maintainability, and reuse opportunities
- Wait for explicit user validation before proceeding to the next phase
- Search for similar patterns that may need the same fix
- Document key findings at each stage

## Why Three-Step Validation:
- Prevents rushed solutions that address symptoms rather than root causes
- Ensures thorough analysis before making code changes
- Allows for course correction at each stage based on user feedback
- Promotes higher quality solutions through structured review
- Reduces the risk of incomplete or poorly implemented fixes
- Maintains focus on long-term codebase health

## Phase Completion:
Each phase must end with presenting findings to the user and asking "Ready to proceed to [next phase]?" before continuing. Never auto-advance between phases.
